# cookiecutter-conda-python
A [cookiecutter](https://www.github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter "cookiecutter") template for
conda packages using Python
 Customized for use with my projects

## Features

 - Modern build system using [pyproject.toml](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/)
 - Automatic versioning with versioneer (requires git annotated tags before it'll work)
 - Ready-made conda recipe found in conda.recipe/meta.yaml
 - Pre-configured for Appveyor, Travis CI and Circle CI (you need to activate each of these individually)
 - Coverage report hosted on Codecov.io (activated after first successful CI run, which uploads results)
 - Code analysis with codacy, setup to exclude versioneer and tests (requires activation of project at Codacy)
 - setup.cfg with flake8 opinions and pytest/pytest-cov configuration (including fixed PYTHONHASHSEED)

## Installation

Prior to installing cookiecutter-conda-python, the cookiecutter package must be installed in your environment. This is achieved via the following command::

    conda install cookiecutter

With cookiecutter installed, the cookiecutter-conda-python template can be installed with::

    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/conda/cookiecutter-conda-python.git

Once cookiecutter clones the template, you will be asked a series of questions related to your project::

    [1/9] full_name (Full Name): (required)
    [2/9] email (Email Address): (required)
    [3/9] github_username (Destination github org or username): (required)
    [4/9] repo_name (repository-name): (required)
    [5/9] package_name (test_pkg): (optional, autogenerated from repository-name)
    [6/9] project_short_description (Short description): (optional)
    [7/9] noarch_python (y): (optional, default yes)
    [8/9] include_cli (y): (optional, default yes)
    [9/9] Select open_source_license
      1 - MIT
      2 - BSD
      3 - ISC
      4 - Apache
      5 - GNUv3
      6 - Proprietary
      Choose from [1/2/3/4/5/6] (1): (optional, default 1)

## Usage

After answering the questions asked during installation, a conda Python package will be
created in your current working directory. This package will contain a simple CLI script
and the conda recipe necessary to build the application into a conda package.

You will need to have conda-build, hatch, hatchling, and hatch-vcs to build::

    conda install conda-build hatch hatchling hatch-vcs

To build the conda package, be sure to set `VERSION`

    VERSION=`hatch version` conda build conda.recipe/

You'll still need to activate the web services you want to use - they won't be active automatically.

 - __Codecov__: No configuration necessary - project will be created when first successful CI run completes and uploads coverage results
 - __Codacy__: https://support.codacy.com/hc/en-us/articles/207278449-Getting-started-with-Codacy
